<p>Throughout my time in university, I have had the privilege to serve as an "agent" for the <a href="https://www.studentsuccess.co/agents/" target="_blank">Student Success Agency</a>â€”a position that involves advising, mentoring, and academically supporting students ages 13-19, from all over the U.S. Each year, my students are asked to rate their time with me out of five with the option to add a comment.</p>

<p>Below is every single comment I have ever recieved. (Yes, including the critical ones.)</p>
 
<div class="card-columns mt-5">
