    <h5 class="card-title">Ethno-Racial Boundary Making and Iranian-Identifying Americans (Undergraduate Sociology Honors Thesis)</h5>
    <p class="card-text">How do Iranian identifying people living in the U.S. describe experiences where their internal ethno-racial ascription differs from an externally ascribed ethno-racial label? For example, an individual may self identify as white but be labeled or perceived as non-white and vice versa. To examine this question, I utilize semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted over the duration of 3-4 months from the greater Los Angeles area. I organized participant’s analyses of their ethnic ascription process recounted in these interviews into four ethno-racial boundary-making strategies. Results entail boundary-making strategies that were classified in the following categories: dis-identification with white, identification with aryan, an emphasis on mixing, and re-classification.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">De-individualizing Blame: Online Activism and the Fat-Acceptance Movement (Undergraduate Anthropology Honors Thesis)</h5>
    <p class="card-text">The fat acceptance movement (also known as the size acceptance movement) is an online movement that has proliferated on social media in recent years. With ties to body positivity and feminist movements, the stated goal of the fat acceptance movement is “radical acceptance of all human bodies.” This paper builds on the existing literature on the fat-acceptance movement by exploring how language is employed in fat advocacy within online community forums. Through an in-depth thematic analysis of FAM social media posts and qualitative interviews with five prominent figures within the movements, I found that FAM activists frame fatness as analogous to other sociological categories of identity that are generally considered to be more fixed. I argue that body-positive activists attempt to shift the understanding of body size from a changeable and fluid facet of identity to a fixed one. They do so as to contest anti-fat bias as a form of serious discrimination while de-legitimize the idea that fatness is a moral responsibility of the individual. Activists adopt and promote an intersectional framework to fatness, often indexically linking the struggle for fat liberation to the struggles for the liberation of other marginalized social identities. </p>
