  quote: "The humanities seek to answer truths that are harder to grasp, and as a result, are more rewarding to know. Maybe it’s time to say: We have computers. We have calculators. What we really are lacking is empaths and freethinkers."

  quote: "My interest in social science research is fueled by my desire to address people’s lived experiences through my work.&#8230;At UCLA and beyond, I want to continue the study of racial boundaries, immigration, acculturation, and diaspora. I want for people both to see others and feel seen in my research."

  quote: "Transfer students, your questions are not stupid. They are a resource in themselves because you can use your curiosity to connect with faculty and fellow students. Also, you can never over-plan, so always get a second opinion. Finally, your self-efficacy is your best weapon—use it."
